1. Chriſt Crucified, AND Judgement Executed.

    _ CHAP. I. The croſs of Chriſt ſet up in men and their dyings upon it; of the life which is loſt and to be found; the father, mother, •nd brethren, huſband, wife, and children, houſe, lands and all things therein to be forſaken for Chriſt, what they are, with the time when, and the manner how.

    _ CHAP. II. How the croſs •f Chriſt is accompanied with the croſſes of the world, firey troyals and perſecutions for the truth, the clouds of Chriſts coming, •nd t•e way of his people in which he leads them, and walks with them to ſave them, how and from what.

    _ CHAP. III. Of the afflictions of Joſeph, his being ſ•l• i•t•Egypt by his Brethren, his being falſly accuſed and mpriſoned; how G•• thereby exalted h m, and Judged •is Breth•en that ſold him; how the ſame was with Chriſt and is with us to this day,

    _ CHAP. IIII. How Pharoah and the Aegyptians, and all that with them to this day do betray and perſecute, accuſe, judge and condemn any for conſcience towards God, are acted by the Devil, hardened and commanded to it by God; how with Cain, Judas, and the Devil, they are all Gods ſervants, doing their devilliſh, dark, and black work, and whoſe ſpirit in them ſhall with the Devil, Death, Hell, and falſe Prophet, and the Beaſt, which was and is not gone into perdition, be damned and dye the ſecond death, when and how.

    _ CHAP. V. A definition of the righteous and the wicked as two parts of three in man to be deſtroyed, and how the third part neither righteous nor wicked is brought through the fire and ſaved; with a diſtinction of Dives and Lazaras•nd their conditions in life and death, and of the dog licking Lazaras,•a•es.

    _ CHAP. VI. That the more purer, innocent, and faithful men are in the truth, the more do men plot and deviſe evil of them to destroy them, as againſt the Lord Prophets, Chriſt and his Apoſtles; how God by his preſence with them delivers them as he did Iſrael, the three Children, Daniel, Jonah ond Jeremiah, and deſtroyed their enemies.

    _ CHAP. VII. How by perſecution truth is increaſed, and the more advanced; and they that ſuffer for it, to the terror of them that perſecute it; that truth is rewarded and witneſſed by ſufferings: how the reward of ſuffrings is a crown of glory manifeſt in men, and when.

    _ CHAP. VIII. How the way to find our life is to loſe it, that no man is to know any thing of himſelf, but to be innocent in knowing his own innocecy and righteouſneſs: alſo what the true knowledge of God is: who hath it, and how its obtained.

    _ CHAP. IX. How all men are alike to God, to whom light and darkneſs is all one: that no man is better nor worſe then another, and how; what it is to be both beſt and worſt in one perſon, to be puniſhed and exalted, and the way unto it; how we are to ſerve one another, and of the ſt•te of Chriſt, as God and man; and how with him we are to love all men.

    _ CHAP. X. Of Gods appearing in Judgment in man, againſt all things of man and this world; that all outward duties, worſhip and obedience by men proſeſſed, is a lye, without the inward work of truth within; how according to the inward work is the outward practice, that the more by Chriſt any man is refined, purged and ſaved within in his conſcience, the more by men is he falſly accuſed, judged and condemned without in his practice.

    _ CHAP. XI. Nothing which oppoſes God can ſtand againſt him, how he will pull down and get above Towers, Churches, worſhips, religions, and all things of men that is not in Chriſt; alſo to whom the Lords Judgements are a day of joy and delight, and to whom they are a day of darkneſs and trouble, to truſt in God under them is a ſure refuge of the good that comes by them, and when.

    _ CHAP. XII. Incouragements to wait with p tience under the Lords Judgements, and not to oppoſe them; Of the works of the Lord Jeſus what they are, and how we bear them about in our bodies, and when.

    _ CHAP. XIII. How men of the greateſt light witneſſing to truth under Judgments, do ſuffer moſt unjuſtly by falſe accuſations with the loſs of all things below God; that not all, but ſome m•n as witneſſes ſhall ſuffer for the reſt af one life; how ſome profeſſing the ſame life, for fear of ſuffering will deny them that ſuffer for them rather then ſuffer with them as the Diſciples of Chriſt did.

    _ CHAP. XIIII. That the true ſufferer will God •nable with joy to bear his burthen to follow Chriſt and deny himſelfe, to truſt in God and rejoyce in all things, how with Chriſt he is humbled to the loweſt with men and e•alted to the higheſt with •od, as the fruit and effect of Gods Judgements, & the ſtate of perfection.
